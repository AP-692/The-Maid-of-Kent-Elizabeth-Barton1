In the quiet village of Aldington near Ashford Kent, sits an interesting house and one that was on one occasion right in the forefront of English history.[^ref1] The Archiepiscopal estate in Aldington was one of the largest of twenty-five manors that the archbishop held in Kent.[^ref2] Cobb Hall was built for the high servant of the Archbishop of Canterbury <param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/William_Warham.jpg" attribution="After Hans Holbein the Younger, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons"> Thomas Cobb, he became the steward of the extensive Aldington estates.[^ref3] Thomas Cobb came from a good family from the Romney Marsh area and came to Aldington in the reign of Edward IV, where his son Thomas made a name for himself as a high servant to the Archbishop of Canterbury that had Cobbs Hall built for him.[^ref4]

However it isn’t the house or its master that his article will be about, but a lowly servant called [Elizabeth Barton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Barton) born in Aldington in 1506.[^ref5]  Thomas Cobb <param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Cobbs_Hall_Aldington_Kent_Geograph-2117504-by-David-Anstiss.jpg" attribution="David Anstiss / Cobb's Hall"> employed Elizabeth Barton as a servant in the 1520’s.[^ref6]  Employed by the Cobbs at a young age and at the age of nineteen her health began to decline so much so that it was believed that she had been stricken with a mortal disease.[^ref7]  It was said that she had been in ‘grievous paine, in-so-much as a man woulde have thought that shee had suffered the pangs of death intselfe, until the disease descended and dell down into the bodie againe.’[^ref8]  However, it was not the disease that made friends and neighbours look upon her with wide eyes, it was the curios visions which she seemed to be able to see and the predictions she started to make during her illness.[^ref9]  People were astonished with Barton’s knowledge of the unseen world and future, she predicted her master’s son would die, and die he did, she could describe what had happened at the church service however she had not left the four walls of her room.[^ref10]  She shared with her neighbours and mistress the glories that she had seen of heaven and the agonies of hell. It wasn’t till after Barton reported of a vision, she had where she would visit the chapel of Our Lady of Court-of-Street then she would be healed.[^ref11]  [William Lambardes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lambarde) <param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/WilliamLambarde.jpg" attribution="National Portrait Gallery, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons"> states in his Perambulation of Kent that upon visiting the chapel Barton was revived ‘from the very point of death,’ and that her healing ‘should be rong for a miracle.’[^ref12]

Cobbs did not know who to turn too, he knew he needed to seek advice, but from where? He turned to Richard Masters the parish priest who came to see Barton and hear some of her revelations for himself, Masters communicated of the prophetess Elizabeth Barton to his Chief Archbishop Warham.[^ref13]  Upon hearing the news Archbishop Warham sent an ecclesiastical commission led by [Edward Bocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bocking) a monk form the [Benedictine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines) house of Christ Church <param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Medalla_San_Benito.PNG" attribution="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Medalla_San_Benito.PNG">, Canterbury to examine Barton.[^ref14]  She was questioned, and the commission found her orthodox on the points of faith. The commission accompanied Barton to the chapel of Our Lady in the village of Court-at-Street in 1526 it was here with the onlook of neighbours, friends, masters and mistresses and the commission that she was miraculously healed.[^ref15]
